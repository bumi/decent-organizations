## How to add new content?

To add new content create a file in the `_posts` directory similar to the existing ones and create a pull request.  
Best use an existing file (like [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bumi/decent-organizations/master/_posts/2017-10-23-colony.md) as a template. 

To create a new file here on GitHub go to [`_posts`](https://github.com/bumi/decent-organizations/tree/master/_posts) and click "Create new file" (on the right).
