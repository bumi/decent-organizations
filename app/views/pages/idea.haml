      %h2 What are decent organisations?

      %p Very good question. We are trying to figure that out ourselves, here are some of our thoughts so far:
      %p We humans cannot solve systemic problems - like inequality, unsustainable growth, unfair labor, or climate change - with linear thinking in hierarchical organizations. That's where decent organizations come in.


      %ul
        %li Decent organizations put humans first - in why, what and how they operate.
        %li Decent organizations are or strive to be decentralized.
        %li Decent organizations discuss what "decent" means.

      %p 
        "decent" as in decentralized and as a synonym for "fair", "reasonable". 
        Organizations with no forced hierarchy and shared ownership among all people involved. 

      %p 
        We believe (decentralized) technology (like blockchain) can support building such organizations.

      %p
        This is a collection of resources and inspirations around this broad topic.
        We hope more people become aware of decent alternatives to current organizational structures

      %p What do you think? We would love to hear from you and collaborate with you - especially if you disagree!
